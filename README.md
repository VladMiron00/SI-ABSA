# SI-ABSA

SI-ABSA stands for Sample and Interpret Aspect-Based Sentiment-Analysis, as the sampling methods and the interpretability algorithms made for ABSA are the two components we focus on in this paper.

The steps mentioned to run the HAABSA++ code, https://github.com/mtrusca/HAABSA_PLUS_PLUS, need to be followed. Files which are downloaded and generated when running HAABSA++ and the virtual environment of HAABSA++ are needed to run SI-ABSA.

After downloading SI-ABSA, https://github.com/VladMiron00/SI-ABSA, move all the contents from this project’s “programGeneratedData” folder into the HAABSA++ “programGeneratedData” folder, replacing all the duplicate files from the HAABSA++ folder with the files from SI-ABSA. You can now delete SI-ABSA’s “data” folder and move the entire “data” folder from HAABSA++ into SI-ABSA. Note that the file 768remainingtestdata2016 original.txt corresponds to “remaining test data”, the complete dataset containing 248 sentences. The dataset we used in this paper is the reduced yet similarly balanced “used test data” of 25 instances, found as 768remainingtestdata2016.txt. Inside SI-ABSA’s main folder, create a folder named “trainedModelMaria”. Inside “trainedModelMaria” create another folder named “2016”.

The virtual environment created to run HAABSA++ can be used to run SI-ABSA.

Now that the file set up is finished and the virtual environment is ready, run main.py. This class will generate inside “trainedModelMaria/2016” the graph representation of LCR-Rot-hop++ ran for our data. This graph is needed to run LIME and LORE.

To run LIME:

Open the “data” folder and create an empty folder named “Lime”. LIME will save its output in a few “.txt” files in this folder. Run Lime.py for the output of LIME. To switch LIME from SS to SSb, scroll down in Lime.py to “if name == ’main’:” and uncomment “main pos()” to run SS for LIME or “main pos balanced()” to run SSb for LIME.

To run LORE:

Open the “data” folder and create an empty folder named “Counterfactuals”. LORE will save its output in a few “.txt” files in this folder. Run Counterfactuals.py for the output of LORE (the counterfactual and the decision rules). To switch from SS to SSb, scroll down in Counterfactuls.py to “if name == ’main’:” and uncomment “main pos()” to run SS for LORE or “main pos balanced 2()” to run SSb for LORE.

To run Sensitiviy Analysis:

In the class BERT pert.py, in the method get perturbations(), modify the hyperparameter “proba change” of function perturb sentence() to values from “0.1” to “1.” to perform sensitivity analysis on the probability of changing a word in x. After altering this hyperparameter, just run Lime.py or Counterfactuals.py with the desired sampling method (SS or SSb) to see the impact of the hyperparameter configuration on the sampling method’s sentiment balance and the interpretability algorithm’s performance.
